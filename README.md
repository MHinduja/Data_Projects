#Project2 FP20 Competition PowerBi
I have created a Power BI dashboard to analyze Mediterranean Camera Company's sales performance. During this challenge, we had to prepare a two-page report based on a dataset, in which we included the following information:
Page 1: Overview of the Company's Sales Performance YTD Report
Page 2: Analysis of Product Data and Time Intelligence Report
 
Overview Insights
1) QoQ sales increased by 21% in quarter 3, but quarter 4 recorded the highest profit, as net sales were highest in October and December, with 12 million each.
2) Institution Buyer were found to be the most profitable ones with an annual profit of 63%
3) The highest sales are recorded on weekdays.
 
Product Analysis Insights.
It is focused on monthly trend analysis of quantity sold and profit earned. It also depicts the most profitable country for the company.
1) As shown, camera 3 is found to have sold the most in all the months because it was the most discounted product. However, the profit was highest in the months of June and December.
2) The unit sold is highest in France, followed by the UK and Italy. But the profit is recorded at its highest in France.
3) Cameras 1 and 2 are the least sold products in all the countries but still profitable.
 
Suggestions
1)     Cameras 4, 5, and 6 have almost all been sold in the same quantity of around 125K, but the profit is earned at its maximum by Camera 5, even though the discount is highest for Camera 6. For the best results, the pricing strategy of Camera 5 should be applied to Cameras 4 and 6.
2)     The marketing strategy in France should be analyzed further and implemented in Greece and the UK to improve business.
